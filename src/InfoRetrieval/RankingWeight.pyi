"""
Information retrieval ranking weight and similarity calculation module.

This module provides comprehensive ranking weight and similarity calculation capabilities for information retrieval systems, with support for TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) weighting and cosine similarity measures. The module is designed as a factory pattern to support extensibility for additional ranking algorithms and similarity measures in the future.

Features:
- TF-IDF weight calculation with logarithmic normalization
- Cosine similarity calculation for vector comparison
- Input validation and error handling for edge cases
- Extensible design for additional ranking algorithms and similarity measures
- Performance-optimized static methods
- Comprehensive parameter validation and sanitization
- Support for both NumPy arrays and Python lists
